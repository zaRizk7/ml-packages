# Personally most commonly used ML/DL Packages I've utilized so far.
My most commonly used PIP packages for ML/DL to ease hassle in Google Colab. To install the packages, execute the command below:

```
%%bash
git clone https://github.com/zaRizk7/ml-packages.git && \
pip install -qr ml-packages/requirements.txt --upgrade
```
